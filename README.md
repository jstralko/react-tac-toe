# react-redux-webpack-starter #

### What is this repository for? ###
* This is a boilerplate starter pack to assist in getting started quicker with React and Redux.
* I've created this to suit my needs, but I hope it can help others as well. Thanks to various resources online I've come up with a boilerplate starter pack to suit my front-end needs. Will add links to some various webpack articles and resources I used in creating this.
* v0.0.1

### How do I get set up? ###
If you do not have webpack and webpack-dev-server set up, please run:
    npm i -g webpack webpack-dev-server

After that, all you need to do is open up your workspace in the command line and run:
    git clone https://svorach@bitbucket.org/svorach/bedrock.git
    cd bedrock
    npm install
    npm run dev
